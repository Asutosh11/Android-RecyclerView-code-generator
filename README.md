<b>Note for Kotlin coders</b> - As of now, this tool only generates code in Java. For Kotlin, you can use the Java to Kotlin converter. <br/><br/>
<b>Introduction about this tool</b><br/>
This is a web app that takes your RecyclerView row item XML layout code as input and generates native Android RecyclerView Adapter and model/POJO class code along with the implementation code.

The web app is hosted here for anyone to use - http://getrecyclerview.herokuapp.com/

<b>How to use the source code to build your own clone ?</b><br>
